### About the Game
Well, you have probably played Hangman once in your life, so you should know the rules! Try to guess the chosen word before you run out of lives or you will be hanged. ðŸ™‚ 

Once you run it, you can type `play` to start the game.

Enter difficulty (easy/medium/hard):
```
- `easy` difficulty chooses words from `easy_wordlist.txt` which contains 1400+ A1-A2 level words.
